        Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons,
and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities. The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and
is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east.
Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning a
total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi) (land area 39,997 km2 (15,443 sq mi)). While the Alps occupy the greater part
of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau,
where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres ZÃ¼rich and Geneva.
