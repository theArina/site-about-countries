        Canada is a country located in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend
 from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres
 (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Canada's southern border
 with the United States is the world's longest bi-national land border. The majority of the country has a cold or
 severely cold winter climate, but southern areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of
 its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. It is highly urbanized with 82 percent
 of the 35.15 million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border.
 Its capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
